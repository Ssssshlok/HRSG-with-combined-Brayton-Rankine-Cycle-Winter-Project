For Assgn3

%% for Brayton 
-The Brayton cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic cycle that governs the operation of gas-turbine power plants and jet propulsion systems, and its performance is strongly influenced by operating conditions such as pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature, and component efficiencies. In this analysis, both the ideal Brayton cycle and a real Brayton cycle were modeled using air-standard assumptions, where air is treated as an ideal gas and the system operates under steady-state, steady-flow conditions with negligible kinetic and potential energy changes. For the ideal cycle, compression and expansion processes were assumed to be isentropic, while heat addition and rejection occurred at constant pressure.
-In contrast, the real Brayton cycle incorporated compressor and turbine irreversibilities through isentropic efficiency definitions, allowing a more realistic representation of actual gas-turbine behavior. Thermodynamic properties such as enthalpy and entropy were evaluated based on temperature, with both constant and temperature-dependent specific heat formulations considered to improve accuracy at high temperatures. A parametric study was conducted by sweeping the pressure ratio over a practical range and evaluating the resulting net work output and thermal efficiency. The results show that thermal efficiency increases monotonically with pressure ratio, reflecting improved utilization of the supplied heat as compression levels rise.
-However, the net work output exhibits a clear maximum at an intermediate pressure ratio, beyond which additional compression causes the compressor work requirement to increase faster than the turbine work output. This behavior is explained by the competing effects of higher turbine expansion potential and rapidly increasing compression work, a fundamental characteristic of the Brayton cycle. For the real cycle, irreversibilities in the compressor and turbine significantly reduce the net work output and thermal efficiency compared to the ideal case, and the back work ratio increases, indicating that a larger fraction of turbine work is required to drive the compressor. 
-These results highlight the critical importance of high component efficiencies in gas-turbine systems, particularly for compressors, which consume a substantial portion of the cycle work. From an engineering perspective, the pressure ratio corresponding to maximum net work output is especially important for power-generation applications where maximizing specific power is a primary objective, whereas applications focused on fuel economy may operate at higher pressure ratios to achieve better thermal efficiency. Overall, this study demonstrates that while the ideal Brayton cycle provides valuable theoretical insight, realistic modeling of component losses and property variations is essential for accurate performance prediction and informed gas-turbine design.

%% for Rankine

-This study presents a thermodynamic analysis and numerical modeling of a conventional steam power plant operating on ideal and real Rankine cycles. The plant operates between a boiler pressure of 3 MPa and a condenser pressure of 75 kPa, with steam superheated to 350 °C at the turbine inlet. First-principles energy and entropy balances were used, with thermodynamic properties from standard steam tables (Çengel). Assumptions include steady-state operation, negligible kinetic and potential energy changes, idealized isentropic expansion and compression for the ideal cycle, and component efficiencies of 75% for the real cycle. The pump is modeled as a compressed-liquid device with constant specific volume, and the condenser exit fluid is saturated liquid.
-For the ideal cycle, turbine work output is 713.1 kJ/kg, pump work input 3.03 kJ/kg, and net work 710.1 kJ/kg, yielding 26.0% thermal efficiency and a low back work ratio of 0.425%. In the real cycle, component inefficiencies slightly reduce net work and efficiency. T–s and h–s diagrams illustrate isentropic expansions, the saturation dome, and constant-pressure heat addition and rejection.
-A parametric study shows that increasing boiler pressure raises heat addition temperature, turbine work, and efficiency, plateauing at high pressures due to practical material and superheat limits. The framework emphasizes accurate property evaluation, continuous thermodynamic paths, and ideal vs. real distinctions, providing quantitative and visual insights for engineering design, performance optimization, and educational purposes.




FOR ASSGN 4 - Not that of a great solution that I uploaded as I found understanding the Rauch Optimization reseaech paper difficult to understand in the given time. 
I have assumed many things and found a particular solution for that assumption. 
Could not create a general solution like i did for Brayton and Rankine cycle because of time issue.
